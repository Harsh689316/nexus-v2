# NEXUS — Investigation Intelligence Platform

NEXUS is a controlled investigation intelligence workspace with adaptive device authentication, jurisdiction-aware access control, relationship analysis and cryptographic audit verification.

## Services

Only two application ports are used:

- **3000** — React/Vite interface
- **4000** — Express authentication API

The Vite development server proxies `/api/*` to port 4000.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run server
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication

The login flow uses an officer ID and password as the first factor, followed by adaptive WebAuthn/passkey authentication when a registered authenticator is available. Supported device authenticators can include Windows Hello, fingerprint, face authentication, platform PIN verification, passkeys and security keys.

If a device cannot use WebAuthn, the officer can use the controlled recovery-code path. A passkey can also be registered on a supported device after recovery verification.

WebAuthn verification is performed by the Express service on port 4000. Registered credential metadata is persisted under `.nexus-auth/` for local continuity.

## Jurisdiction hierarchy

- **Investigator / Inspector:** assigned operational area
- **Senior Investigator / SI / ACP / SP / DCP:** assigned city
- **DIG / IG / ADG / DGP:** assigned division

The data service filters persons, cases, relationships, transactions, tips, searches and graph entities against the authenticated officer's clearance and jurisdiction. In a production deployment, the same policy must also be enforced at the database/API layer; client-side filtering alone is not a security boundary.

## Network intelligence graph

The relationship graph is responsive, searchable, zoomable, draggable and jurisdiction-scoped. Selecting an entity opens its authorized dossier context, and graph links are limited to records visible to the current officer.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```


## Remote one-time recovery
The authentication flow now supports administrator-approved recovery requests. An officer requests recovery after password verification; a `system_admin` approves the request; NEXUS generates a cryptographically random 8-digit code that expires after 5 minutes and can be used once. If Resend is configured, the code is emailed to the officer's server-side verified recovery address. If email is not configured, the code is shown only to the system administrator so it can be communicated through an approved secure channel.

### Hosted deployment
1. Host the Vite frontend on an HTTPS domain.
2. Host `server.js` on a backend service with Node 20+ and port 4000 (or map the platform's public port to the app's `PORT`).
3. Set `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` to the exact HTTPS frontend origin and `RP_ID` to the frontend hostname. WebAuthn requires HTTPS in production.
4. Configure `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RECOVERY_FROM_EMAIL`, then set `RECOVERY_EMAIL_<OFFICER_ID>` variables for verified officer mailboxes.
5. Never put provider API keys in Vite/client environment variables.
6. For production, replace in-source officer passwords with a database/identity provider, move sessions to a persistent server-side store, add CSRF protection/rate limiting, and store recovery/audit data in durable storage.


## Recovery flow verification

After `npm run server` is running on port 4000, log in on port 3000 with an officer ID and password. If no passkey is registered, choose **Request recovery**. The request is created by `POST /api/auth/recovery/request` and appears to the isolated `system_admin` account under Settings. The administrator approves it, which issues a random one-time code. The officer's screen polls the recovery status until it becomes `APPROVED`, then accepts the one-time code.

The Security Administrator also has a local bootstrap recovery path for first-time local testing using the seeded administrator recovery code. This is intended only for local development; disable it for production.


## GitHub safety and secret management

Officer passwords and recovery codes are loaded only from server-side environment variables. No authentication secret belongs in `server.js` or frontend source. The committed `.env.example` contains placeholders only.

Before pushing to GitHub:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a local `.env` or `.env.local` and replace placeholders with strong unique values.
2. Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.nexus-auth/`, API keys, private keys, certificates, local databases, or build artifacts.
3. Use GitHub/hosting secret management for deployed credentials.
4. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
5. Review `git status` and staged changes for credentials before pushing.
6. Rotate any credential that was ever committed; removing it later does not make the old secret safe.

The isolated Security Administrator is kept separate from the police command hierarchy, and its credentials are server-side only.


## PERN + CCTNS Upgrade

The project now includes a PostgreSQL-backed data path while preserving a synthetic fallback for demonstrations. The backend can expose 120 synthetic persons, **500 synthetic investigation cases**, 900 graph relationships, and 1,200 financial transactions. Synthetic records are explicitly marked and must not be confused with live police data.

### CCTNS / ICJS boundary

NEXUS includes an authorized CCTNS/ICJS adapter boundary and a real-time e-FIR intake workflow. The connector is disabled until `CCTNS_BASE_URL` and `CCTNS_API_KEY` are configured in the protected server environment. Do not scrape, bypass, or attempt unauthorized access to CCTNS. In production, the adapter should be connected through the applicable authorized police/government network and interface.

The ingestion flow is:

`New FIR → Validation → SHA-256 payload proof → Entity resolution → Case creation → Knowledge graph update → AI analysis → Investigator alert → Audit/ledger record`

Raw sensitive evidence is not placed on-chain. The blockchain layer should store hashes, timestamps, provenance, signatures, and chain-of-custody metadata; the evidence itself remains in encrypted controlled storage.

### PostgreSQL

Set `DATABASE_URL`, then run `npm run db:migrate` to ensure the FIR ingestion table exists. Use `npm run db:seed` to populate the synthetic dataset. `docker-compose.yml` provides a local PostgreSQL 16 instance.

### FIR intake persistence

The **CCTNS / e-FIR Ingestion** page submits the Add latest FIR form to `POST /api/cctns/firs`. The API validates the authenticated session, normalizes the payload, creates a SHA-256 payload hash, persists the FIR in PostgreSQL `firs`, and creates a linked investigation case. Duplicate `(source_system, fir_number)` submissions are detected without creating a second FIR. The page reloads recently ingested FIRs directly from PostgreSQL so persistence is visible immediately.

For an existing PostgreSQL volume created before the FIR table was added, run:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

Use synthetic/demo FIR content during local development. Do not enter real sensitive police records into this development database.

### CCTNS source

CCTNS is the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems operated within India's criminal-justice data ecosystem. ICJS integrates police/CCTNS with courts, prisons, forensics and prosecution. This project implements an integration boundary rather than claiming direct access to government systems.

## FIR intake verification

The FIR intake pipeline is fail-closed: a successful HTTP response is only returned after the FIR has been validated and, when PostgreSQL is configured, persisted in the database transaction together with its case and audit record. Duplicate FIR numbers from the same source are idempotently recognized.

Run the adapter/validation test suite from the project root:

```powershell
npm install
npm run test:fir
```

For the live PostgreSQL integration test, configure `DATABASE_URL` first. Without it, the pure FIR tests still run and the live database test is explicitly skipped rather than pretending to have passed.

Recommended live verification:

```powershell
npm run db:migrate
npm run test:fir
npm run server
npm run dev
```

The API remains on port `4000` and the Vite frontend remains on port `3000`.
